Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a website about my favourite vegan food. The main page contains information about veganism. The other three pages contain information about my favourite starter, main, and dessert, respectively.

In the index.html file, you'll see the Home page. The starter.html, main.html, and dessert.html contain the subpages for each course with recipes and images. The styling0.css file contains the styling sheet for the html files.
